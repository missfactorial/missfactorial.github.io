0050,Lead Instructor,DS4A Career Accelerator program,Correlation One,"May 8, 2024",,Virtual,"We recently completed a training engagement for the DS4A Career Accelerator program, organized by Correlation One. The program, sponsored by Target, Point72, Johnson & Johnson, and the Match Group, focuses on advancing data science professionals from underrepresented communities by providing free access to a four-week program featuring top-tier professional development training.

As the Lead Instructor, Viviana worked with the cohort on essential professional development areas, including resume improvement, professional branding, and data storytelling for interview success. The sessions were designed to be interactive and engaging, with a focus on providing practical tools and strategies that learners could apply immediately to their career growth. The resources and guidance offered throughout the program helped participants strengthen their professional profiles and build confidence as they prepared for the next steps in their careers.",
0049,Volunteer,Accessibility Hackathon ,Code Your Dreams and Deaf Kids Code,"March 9, 2024","Chicago, IL, USA",Google HQ,"Viviana recently participated as volunteer in the 'Hack for Accessibility' event, co-hosted by Code Your Dreams and Deaf Kids Code at the Google Chicago office. This inspiring gathering focused on making technology more accessible for everyone, bringing together participants from high school, university, and professional backgrounds.

Keynote speaker Rebecca Giuntoli, Miss Austin 2024, shared her experiences navigating college as a person who is deaf. She spoke about the lack of representation of deaf individuals in STEM, which led her to create new signs for technical terms that didn‚Äôt have them. Her story powerfully illustrated how challenges can become opportunities to enrich American Sign Language and emphasized the need for accessibility and representation in tech.

The hackathon aimed to create real, impactful innovations that break down barriers within technology and promote accessibility. More than just a hackathon, it was part of a movement toward a more inclusive world. We were proud to support an initiative that empowers individuals to make technology more inclusive for everyone.",
0048,Outreach talk,The Future is Now: Discover the Power of Artificial Intelligence,,"March 7, 2024","Chicago, IL, USA",Consulate of Colombia in Chicago,"The conference ""The Future is Now: Discover the Power of Artificial Intelligence"" at the Colombian Consulate General in Chicago was a complete success üöÄ

We spent a very pleasant afternoon with fellow Colombians demystifying the technology behind AI and sharing tips on how to use it in everyday life without needing to be an expert. The public was so excited that we ended up having a fruitful debate on the impacts of AI on our lives and society, with everyone expressing their views on the pros and cons of this technology.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And for those who were bit by the tech bug after the talk and wanted to get involved, Brianne Caplan üåü from Code Your Dreams showcased the opportunities this non-profit foundation has for the residents of Chicago and opened the door for new collaborations.

Thank you Chicago üèôÔ∏èüçïüå¨Ô∏è for the warm welcome and big thanks to the Colombian Consulate and the General Consul Diego Angulo for opening its doors for us to have such a special afternoon ‚ô•Ô∏è
